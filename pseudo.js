Pseudo Code:

I got stuck on the helpers and couldn't get my API key to work. I rather just move on and get help in office hours.

1. In my main.js I need to create a saveArticle and deleteArticle function that utilizes my helpers
to find the ID of my saved articles from my getArticle in my helpers. 

The savearticle will call upon the postArticle from the helpers and get the results for the headline, date, and url

The deleteArticle i'm not too sure about

These should render in the respective places for QUERY and RESULTS in my main.js.

2. My results page needs to be updated to reflect my parameters(title, date, url).

3. my server needs to be updated with the specifics for my get and post routes
